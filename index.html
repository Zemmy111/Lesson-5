                    flower, the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As popularly used, the term “flower” especially
                    applies when part or all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form.
                    
                    
                    petunia
                    Pink variegated flowers of a common garden petunia (Petunia ×atkinsiana).
                    
                    lilac
                    Common lilac (Syringa vulgaris).
                    In their range of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement, flowers present a seemingly endless variety of
                    combinations. They range in size from minute blossoms to giant blooms. In some plants, such as poppy, magnolia, tulip,
                    and petunia, each flower is relatively large and showy and is produced singly, while in other plants, such as aster,
                    snapdragon, and lilac, the individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a distinctive cluster known as an
                    inflorescence. Regardless of their variety, all flowers have a uniform function, the reproduction of the species through
                    the production of seed.
